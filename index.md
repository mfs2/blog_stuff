title: Dear Windham voter 
---

---
On Saturday, March 9, at 10a.m., at the Meeting House, you will have a chance to decide on a better education for Windham kids at a lower cost to taxpayers. YOU MUST BE PRESENT TO VOTE!
---
You will be asked to vote on the following article. Please read it carefully.
---
“Shall the School Board of the Windham School District provide for the elementary education of students by paying tuition in accordance with law to one or more public elementary schools in one or more school districts for the 2024-2025 school year and continuing thereafter?”
---
Here’s why we urge you to vote “yes” on this article.

A vote for school choice is a vote for Windham kids. Kids learn best with experienced teachers in calm school environments. The Windham elementary school has not been able to provide either of these. Last summer’s last-ditch efforts to staff the school were a disaster. We have no guarantees of better outcomes this year. 

A vote for school choice is a vote for Windham families. Today’s Windham families need a say in where their kids go to school. Many Windham families have stated that they would prefer to school their kids outside of Windham. They want:

    • a calm, reliable environment with seasoned teaching staff 
    • more school amenities (sports, after-school activities, lunch, music, art, clubs, more kids to play with!)
    • convenience of school location to workplace and family activities

A vote for school choice is a vote for Windham taxpayers. The rising cost of keeping the school open is not sustainable. The cost has increased more than 50% over the past 3 years. Towns that pay tuition for all their kids see annual average increases of around 4% per year. It’s time to vote “no” on this year’s school budget. (More info, next page.)

 Vote “yes” for school choice!
Vermont school budgets are complicated. Here’s what you need to know:

If you’ve got 1 minute, read this:
    • Paying tuition instead of operating a school is cheaper, both in the short-run and the long-run, because it has the effect of lowering annual budget increases. This is because inflationary factors like salaries and benefits are spread over many voters instead of a few. 
    • The Windham school budget is 26% higher this year than last year. Your taxes will go up. Lots of factors drove the increase (including some our school board has no control over). Vote “no” on the school budget at town meeting to show that you need relief, no matter what’s driving the increase in your school tax.

If you’ve got 2 more minutes, read this too: 
    • According to a VT Senate Finance Committee report, Windham leads the state in the size of increase in school “spending.” 
    • “Spending” is budget total minus non-tax revenue, such as grants.
    • Proposed spending for next year (Fiscal Year 25) increases 51.32% over the current year (FY 24), way higher than any other school district in VT. 
    • Why has this happened? Act 127, passed in 2022, helps towns like Windham with our spending by taking into account such factors as sparse population and poverty. BUT at the same time, the state “small schools grant,” is ending, lowering our non-tax revenue. The result: our spending has seen a sharp increase. 

If you’ve got plenty of time, try this:
    • Look at the proposed FY 25 school budget in your annual report. This is a budget for operating the school.
    • Now, look at the “non-operational” budget commissioned by our school board. This is a budget for paying tuition for Windham children to other area public schools. It can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQD-DrP--J3wgkjEMnWjI-6JiQp5Jyps/view. 
    • THE “NON-OPERATIONAL” BUDGET IS FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES ONLY AND WILL NOT BE VOTED ON AT TOWN MEETING. This budget uses cost estimates that are intentionally high. Even so, the cost for tuitioning the kids is still lower than the cost for operating the school.

VOTE “NO” ON THE BUDGET. VOTE “YES” FOR SCHOOL CHOICE
