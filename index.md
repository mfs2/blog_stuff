title: Windmam Committee For School Choice
---
Neither Left nor Right but some of each and a few Socialists. 
We are people who think Windham and Windam's children will be better by being tuitioned to another area school.
That proposal will be voted on at this year's town meeting. 
And a lot more stuff to add later...
